There's a couple of times while. I'll be talking to the room about this particular phenomena and. I'll bring someone up and. I'll just have them standing there and.

I'll start making them sway while. I'm talking and not telling them. I'm doing it to them and they'll be swaying right. Along with me and everybody starts laughing and they're like and the person is like what because there's different levels to your awareness there's what you're consciously paying attention to at any given moment and.

Then there's everything else you're dealing with the everything else you're going to connect the everything else level to what they're consciously paying attention to in a way that's synergistic this is what creates that. Affinity that you want people to feel towards you and it's extremely useful even in self-defense or combative situations when you can do this you can feel what people are going to do long before they ever do it any place you can see another human being you can do this you may not be able to make them sway all that much. But really what we're going for isn't the sway part it's the feeling that lets us know we have the connection.
