Hi i'm dr david snyder and one of the most powerful things i've discovered in 15 years of working with physiological illness is that everything human beings do is in response to a feeling feeling they either want more of a feeling that you don't want less of a feeling they've locked inside their body now whether you think your feelings are because of something you're seeing or something you're hearing or something you're smelling they all result in a body feeling and that's how we attack those feelings that's how we get them out of your body and out of your life and we change your beliefs and your memories forever it starts with understanding where in your body those feelings are stored because if you can point to where you feel it you can change it let me show you how to do that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]. So wow all right. Grab a partner my whole body was vibrating bless you different huh yeah.
