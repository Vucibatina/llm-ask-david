They write yeah okay. Do. Selena do you have a shorter name or type oh do you do you like that better do you like - yo. Selena better clean.

Then we will use vo. Selena and close your eyes. Do. Selena take a deep breath in let that breath out with a sigh deeper and deeper with every breath you take every beat of your heart.

I just want you to relax to let go to listen to the sound of my voice now any sound you hear other than the sounds of my voice are simply the sounds of our natural environment they're not going to disturb you or distract you in any way in fact all they're going to do is signal you that it's time to completely relax to let go to realize that no. Matter how far inside you travel no. Matter how deep inside you go you'll always be able to hear my words and follow my instructions may my command because you realize that everything. I say and everything.

I do is for you now in a moment not yet. But in just a moment do. Selena. I want you to begin to relax the tiny muscles in your eyelids.

I'd like you to relax them more and more and more. So they're. So relaxed you couldn't actually open them without tensing them back up again until they're. So relaxed they just don't want to work well you know you've got them that relaxed.

So relaxed they just don't want to work all. I want you to do is give them a little test just to be sure earth and when you're ready only when you're ready stop testing that that level of relaxation flow from the top of your head all the way down to the tips of your toes deeper and deeper with every breath you take and every beat of your heart drifting dreaming flow guided by the sound of my voice now in a moment not yet. But in just a moment feel. So there now.

I'm going to ask you to begin to relax your mind as deeply as we've relaxed your body would like you to do that in a very special way now in a moment not yet. But in just a moment. I'm going to ask you to begin to imagine the alphabet backwards starting with the letter. Z with each and every breath we take in each and every beat of your heart all.

I want you to do to relax those letters completely out of your monuments allow them if you will to become smaller and darker and harder to see turn the volume all [Music] down deeper and people sound that's right. Now in a moment not yet. But in just a moment girls today and. I'd like you to use that amazing imagination of yours and.

I'm usually give my clients and my students a choice either sort back through your memories or if you prefer to just go deeply into your imagination to a time in a place when you felt absolutely safe absolutely protected from all threats real or imaginary where you are completely in control and allowed to be induce and to express yourself in any way you want and it was perfectly acceptable perfectly okay. As you go into that space some people say places are places where they grew up some people say places are more spiritual or religious in nature like a church or a temple or synagogue a mosque or. Nash. Ram we're a little on the metaphysical side maybe it's just a sacred space surrounded by your spirit guides or guardian angels or whatever manner of being populates your particular belief system some people's are a little bit more interesting.

I had one young lady out in the. United. Kingdom her idea of a safe place was a nuclear fallout shelter five miles below the surface of the earth surrounded in lead and concrete and there was only enough room in that sucker for her. I guess what.

I'm really trying to say beyond. Selena is that no. Matter what size are shaved for what genre or flavor niche your safe place takes well it's perfect for you you're allowed to decorate it and create it in any way that gives you peace and happiness and joy and a sense of empowerment a sense of being able to freely express yourself and be everything you want in all the ways that satisfy and fulfill you for all the right. Reason and the interesting thing is that the one thing all safe places have in common that when you're in that state place when you see what you see and you hear what you hear and you smell what you smell you taste what you smell in your taste there's a sensation somewhere in your body that you get a sensation that lets you know you're completely safe how much they take a moment scan your body and notice where in your body that feeling lives.

I want you to go ahead and point to it for me. First that's right. I want you to notice that there's a color connected to that amazing feeling maybe a series of colors what would those colors be for you the observing and the. First impression cleaning.

Jenna's green and yellow that's right. I want you to notice how the feelings in your body begin to shift and change is a beautiful ball of that green and yellow energy materializes above your head. I want you to notice how with every breath you take into every beat of your heart that energy begins to double in size and shape double in force and magnitude begins to grow and expand to fill the room from floor to ceiling from wall to wall in all points in between wrapping itself around you like a beautiful blanket of safe green and yellow energy like a cocoon a shield a suit of armor protecting you and saving you from all things real or imagined and feeding you an endless ever-expanding infinite unlimited supply of all the nourishment all the acceptance that your body most wants and desires and needs in an endless ever-expanding infinite and unlimited supply and money ready. I want you to breathe that energy through your entire being from the top of your head to the tips of your toes let it fill you up like water fills up a bottle like fluid fills up a test tube like hot air or helium fills up a balloon when you know you're completely filled from the top of your head to the tips of your toes and all points in between just nod your head to let me know excellent.

I would like you to scan your body one. Last time notice any place in your body where you're harboring any tension any tightness any density these are places where our unconscious mind is stored feelings and thoughts and memories and experiences like a little hard drive corentinÂ´s a virus as you find those places. I want you to breathe your yellow and green energy through those areas let that energy flow over around and through those areas like hot water flows over an ice cube notice how the feelings in your body shift and change those areas begin to dissolve - no. It's all dissolved and resolved from the body it's all dissolved and resolved from the mind for all the right.

Reasons and when you know they're completely gone it's not your head. But. I just when many of my clients often report that as those spaces dissolve away they feel like the change to their life the change to their spirit have been unlocked they feel an expansion a release of their spirit and it begins to grow inside and expand beyond the limits of the physical body merging like a drop of water merges into the ocean into that cloud of safe energy feeling that sense of reunion reconnection with all of its potential all the things you're born here to do that sense of empowerment worthiness deserving this all restraints lifted for all the right. Reasons now as you flow deeper and deeper into that space many of my clients often report a sense of expansion empowerment that in this place anything that you can imagine anything you can intend anything you can physically act out with both of your hands and your entire body must must must become real and true and made manifest in the external world because all the experts agree the asana whether you're talking about the most cutting-edge and educated of quantum researchers and mechanics physics or studying the ancient master the spiritual teachers from times long gone regardless of the time period or the words that they use or what part of the world they come from they all seem to agree on one thing and that it's your inner world that controls and manifests and expresses the outer world and well it's not always possible to anticipate every situation or circumstance every variable that may come at us from the outside world inside the.

Angelina and you are all-powerful you have every right. Privilege and authority to make any change you want for any reason you want you are the goddess of your universe the queen of your neurology and anything you want it's perfectly allowed for all the right. Reasons beyond. Selena there's a feeling that you've been having a feeling you've been carrying around for quite some time a feeling that you'd like to change.

I'd like you to notice where in your body that feeling lives and go ahead and point to it for me [Music]. I want you to notice there's a color or a series of colors connected to that feeling what are those colors. First impressions purple that's right. I want you to trace the outline of that energy with both of your hands to know exactly what shape it takes tell me about that shape [Music] tell me about that shape.

First impression what's the cool shape is it [Music] like a triangle and as you focus on that purple triangle is it have any weight temperature or texture to it yes. Heavy and is it in your body out of your body part in and part out in the mind in the body. So as you look. This one that heavy purple triangle that's in your body.

I'm curious how old might you be when you. First feel a feeling like that or that's right. And where might you be when you. First feel that feeling where might you be when you.
