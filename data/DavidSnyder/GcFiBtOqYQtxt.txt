So. I want you to stop for a moment all right. And. I want you to contemplate what it would be feel like to just be all-powerful just to have the entire universe to amaze you.

I would defers to you does what you say with or without you're asking it to just contemplate what that would be like and what it feels like without the human ego it just is just be in that energy and. Then maybe around that you want to wrap all loving right. Imagine the most powerful loving force that could possibly be that's right. And if there were a color connected to those two.

Powers those two elements what would it be breathe them into your heart fill your body with it there are sound a taste a smell merge into that being eternal having no. Beginning no. End having always existed and non-existent infinite that's right. Might there be a color or frequency a set of colors a sound a taste a smell breathe those through your whole body and into your heart and.

Finally would it be like to be all-knowing be the source and the receiver of all things to know to understand from every perspective simultaneously the biggest picture most smallest detail is there a color is there a sound they're feeling their smell breathe them all into your heart as well breathe all four of those wonderful attributes merge them fully and. Then close your eyes. And descend your consciousness the center of it find the center of that merged with it and just go deeper deeper and deeper in until that space is as big as the entire universe you just keep going in and experience it just be there and as you go deeper in allow that power and that love and that knowledge to grow outwards as you grow inwards encompassing everything and just be just be and when you're ready come on back. God's calling.

God's calling a little warm. Rosie foreign [Music] [Laughter].
