But a series of perceptual filters that we assign relationships to cause and effect complex equivalents we've been on the webinar. I should hear me talk about that perceptual filter is your window on reality the reality you live in is modulated by your perceptual filters the emotional refractory period is the mechanism that modifies and changes those perceptual filters every single time you have a state change how many of you have ever had this experience you've been in an argument with somebody you're going back and forth he said she said she said she said she said he said.
