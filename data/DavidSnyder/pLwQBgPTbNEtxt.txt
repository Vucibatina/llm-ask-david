Close your eyes. Put your hands in your lap put your feet flat on the floor take a long breath in let that breath out with a side deeper and deeper with every breath you take every beat of your heart. I just want you to give yourself permission to allow yourself to go on a very short. But amazingly powerful journey with me as you focus all of your attention on the lids of your eyes.

And you relax those tiny muscles in your eyelids relax them to the point that they're. So relaxed you couldn't actually open them without putting tension back into them relax them that deeply or even more and when you know you've got them that relaxed just test them real quick to be sure they won't work perfect now stop testing when you're sure that that level of relaxation flow from the top of your head all the way down to the tips of your toes deeper and deeper with every breath you take and every beat of your heart. I just want you to let go to relax as. I guide you inside deep inside your mind body and spirit is a place of absolute power a place of absolute change a place where you store things that are useful and sometimes things that were useful at one time.

But not. So useful anymore and. I want you to imagine if you would a portal of some kind now for some of you it might be a glowing archway because. I'm kind of metaphysical that way some of you it might be an elevator door some of you might be a cellar door maybe it's a big oaken door with heavy knockers whatever it is for you what's your notice that place inside.

I want you to reach out with your physical hands cause that portal to open in the way that's right. Natural for you and as you enter that place inside. I want you to walk inside that room and. I want you to notice what you see inside you see interesting moments dome-shaped with pearly gray walls at the center of this room is this beautiful glowing fireplace it radiates a warmth an energy that just causes you to feel freedom the flame of freedom inside and on the wall they want you to look.

Around you may notice that there's certain pieces of paper or it could be something else. I know one person who went to their gray room they found that those things on the wall were tile is that he had a break and smash and. Then he broke them and he smashed him and all of a sudden he felt liberated as all that weight was lifted from his body and from his mind whatever it is for you if it's pieces of paper great if it's tiles that's okay. Too you know the process know one set of tiles or papers or whatever is in one color and it represents all the positive experiences in your life all another color represents all the less than positive experiences all the things you've been holding on to that no.

Longer serve you that you're ready to let go of that you're willing to let go of and as if by some secret cue one of those pieces of paper calls your attention and you walk over to it. I want you to reach out and. I want you to touch that piece of paper or that tile or whatever it is. I want you to notice as you touch it that there's a feeling in your body that comes up as soon as you touch it notice where you feel it and.

I want you to take that thing off the wall and. I want you to begin together smash it or crumple it up or make it less than what it was and notice how as you begin to manipulate that image with your mind and body. But it's how it begins to change the feeling when you're. Finally ready to get rid of it walk over tumble it up throw it in the fire watch what you'll feel that energy burn up feel your body shift and.

And natural for you give yourself permission it doesn't let it go noticing how good you feel and when you know that one's all burnt up when you feel the energy release to whatever degree you're willing to let yourself do that. Wow walk over to the. Next piece take it off the wall notice where in your body you feeling begin to crumple it up crack it up make it smaller notice how it changes the feeling when you're ready walk over to that fire pit chuck it in the fire wash feel it burn up.

I'm gonna suggest that the more you get the body involved the more amazing this experience is gonna be for you. But that's okay. Give yourself permission now. I want you to systematically move through this room begin to remove all of those things from the wall that no.
