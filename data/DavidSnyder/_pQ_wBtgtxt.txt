You how many of you how if you want to go out and do and do therapy in the world rate just. So. I see that good some people help. Tommy people be it's just a nice idea that they do it if they have that if you know the opportunity.

Then itself and you feel like it that's okay. The one thing. I want you there reason we call this renegade hypnosis is because it's no. Holds barred hypnosis okay.

I am going to break the lines of politically-correct often and consistently because it needs to be done okay. There's a very very strong tendency in the hypnosis world to keep you confined to this little box about what hypnosis is and what it is not while the rest of the world the more informed parts of the world are hitting you with hypnotic operators left and right. Designed to keep you in a pathological state of trance and/or confusion or both. So that they can implant into you what they want okay.

The only way to fight that the only way to defend yourself against it is to speak the language of it or to understand it okay. And. So. I'm gonna be sharing a lot of things with you that.

I've discovered along the way things that have worked magnificently well for me and once you understand it and expand your view of hypnotic phenomenon or hypnotic operators you're gonna see the view like we call it seeing the matrix and once you see the matrix you gain tremendous power over the matrix okay.
